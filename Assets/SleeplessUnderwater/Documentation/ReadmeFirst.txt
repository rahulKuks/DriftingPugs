Sleepless Underwater Effects - Version 1.2.0.0

1. Due to the number of complaints and questions from users who were not sure why there were errors initially and were not able to reimport the Standard Assets, we have removed all of the Unity Standard Effects from Version 1.0 and replaced the effects and controllers with simple alternatives. 
The attached PDF and below Tutorial Video can explain how to wire this effect up to the Unity Standard First Person Controller if you are still interested in using those. It will also help explain how to wire up the water to use the Unity Water if you are interested. 

2. We have added a Third Person Controller Scene to show how the effect will work in the 3rd Person as well as the 1st Person Controller scene. 

3. We have introduced a new variable called m_IsSwimming as well. This has been frequently requested to allow the player to surface and control the movement in the water with SPACE and C keys as opposed to previously where as soon as the camera went underwater, the player sank slowly.
